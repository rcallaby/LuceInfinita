# Product Roadmap

This is a potential product roadmap for this open source software. IF you're an experienced systems designer and know of ways to improve this piece of software then let me know.

## 1. **Core Components**

#### 1.1 **Port Scanner (Nmap-like functionality)**
The port scanner should efficiently scan large networks and detect open ports on specified hosts. This would require:
- **Multithreading/Asynchronous I/O:** To allow fast, parallel scanning of multiple targets.
- **Raw Socket Support:** Using raw sockets for both TCP and UDP scanning. Implement different scan types like SYN, ACK, and UDP.
- **Service Detection:** Query open ports to identify the service running (e.g., HTTP, SSH).
- **Version Detection:** Use banner grabbing or more advanced techniques to identify versions of services.

#### 1.2 **Post-Exploitation Framework (pwncat-cs-like functionality)**
This should include a system for interacting with compromised machines:
- **Reverse/Bind Shells:** Establish persistent or on-demand shells.
- **File Transfer Mechanisms:** Transfer files across the network securely.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Built-in privilege escalation techniques for remote hosts.
- **Remote Execution:** Execute commands on remote systems and retrieve output efficiently.

## 2. **Architecture Layers**

#### 2.1 **Network Layer**
This will handle all the raw networking operations, including port scanning, banner grabbing, and connection handling.
- **Raw Socket Interface:** Low-level implementation for interacting with network packets.
- **TCP/UDP Protocol Handlers:** Separate handlers for TCP and UDP scans.
- **Asynchronous I/O Support:** Implement this layer with non-blocking sockets using `epoll` (Linux), or `select/poll` for cross-platform compatibility.

#### 2.2 **Task Scheduler**
This layer will manage the task flow across the port scanning and post-exploitation phases. A task scheduler is crucial for scalability:
- **Task Queue:** Each network operation (scan, banner grab, reverse shell initiation) is a task in the queue.
- **Worker Pool:** A configurable pool of worker threads or coroutines to execute tasks.
- **Priority Queue:** Some tasks (e.g., service enumeration on open ports) might have higher priority over others.

#### 2.3 **Post-Exploitation Layer**
For handling compromised machines and managing sessions:
- **Session Manager:** Manages multiple reverse shells or bind shells and keeps track of connected hosts.
- **Modular Command Execution:** A modular design that allows adding more post-exploitation techniques (e.g., credential dumping, lateral movement) in the future.
- **Persistence Techniques:** Ability to maintain persistence on a compromised system (e.g., through cron jobs, registry, services).

#### 2.4 **Service Enumeration & Banner Grabbing**
A middle layer to identify services running on discovered ports.
- **Fingerprinting Module:** Identify services based on protocol responses (e.g., HTTP banners, SSH versions).
- **Version Matching:** Match against a database of known services and versions (like Nmap’s version database).

## 3. **Extensibility & Future Improvements**
#### 3.1 **Modular Architecture**
- **Plugin System:** Implement a plugin system for adding new features (e.g., new exploits, new scan techniques) without modifying the core codebase. This would allow other developers to contribute modules.
- **Shared Libraries for Core Features:** Core features like networking and scanning should be in shared libraries to facilitate easy upgrades and testing of components independently.

#### 3.2 **Database Integration**
- **Service Fingerprinting Database:** Allow for a local database of service signatures (like Nmap’s `nmap-services`).
- **Vulnerability Database:** Integrate with a local or remote vulnerability database for immediate vulnerability assessment based on detected versions.

#### 3.3 **Logging & Reporting**
- **Structured Logging:** JSON or XML logging to make it easy to parse and generate reports.
- **Report Generation:** Automated generation of scan and exploitation reports for future audits.

## 4. **Error Handling and Robustness**
A networking tool is exposed to multiple network scenarios (timeouts, dropped packets, wrong configurations), so:
- **Timeout and Retry Logic:** Built-in timeout mechanisms with retry strategies for scans or exploitations.
- **Error Recovery:** Gracefully handle errors and ensure the rest of the tasks continue even after a failure in one section.

## 5. **Configuration and CLI Design**
A flexible configuration mechanism will enable the tool to be adapted for different use cases without changing the code.
- **Configuration File Support:** YAML or JSON-based configuration for specifying scanning parameters, targets, and post-exploitation commands.
- **Command-Line Interface:** A rich CLI for configuring and running scans, setting up listeners, and managing post-exploitation tasks.

## 6. **Security Considerations**
- **Encrypted Communication:** All communication with compromised machines should be encrypted using TLS to avoid detection and to keep operations secure.
- **Evasion Techniques:** Implement evasion techniques (e.g., adjusting scan timing, packet spoofing) to reduce the chance of being detected by IDS/IPS systems.

## 7. **Performance Optimizations**
- **Efficient Memory Use:** Handle large-scale scans with minimal memory overhead.
- **Load Balancing:** In scenarios where there are many targets, distribute tasks across multiple systems or use sharding techniques to scale horizontally.

## 8. **Sample System Design**

## Future Considerations
1. **Distributed Scanning**: Allow distributing tasks across multiple systems for large-scale scanning.
2. **Cloud Integration**: Integrate with cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) to deploy scanning and exploitation modules at scale.
3. **Machine Learning**: Explore integrating machine learning techniques for more accurate service detection and version identification.

This design provides a flexible, scalable system that could be used for both network reconnaissance (Nmap-like) and post-exploitation (pwncat-cs-like) while leaving room for future improvements and extensions.
